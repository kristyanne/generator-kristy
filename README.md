> Just playing around with a custom [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator.

## What does it do?

Not a lot. At the moment it just asks for some info, creates some directories and replaces values in index.html. Exciting.

## How to use this amazing tool

This ain't no registered NPM module, so we'll just be using it locally. Grab the project files and let's DO THIS.

### Install Yeoman
Firstly, you need yeoman to be installed globally, so do that (or don't if you already have it, obvs):

`npm install -g yo`

### Install the Node Modules

make sure you're in the generator directory (awks) and then run this:

`npm install`

### Something to do with Symlinks.

again, in the generator directory, do this:

`npm link`

I can't remember why. Probably should find out why. I think it's so we can run the generator from anywhere? Yeah, maybe that.

### Run (for your life)

We are ready to BLOW MINDS. Create a directory somewhere for your new project and cd into it.

Then, let's get generating with our generator:

`yo kristy`

Then watch the magic happen. How disappointing.
